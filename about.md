For this simple [GitHub Pages](http://github.io) I'm just using an auto-generated [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new) so
to keep you from having to re-read what's already available in the footer of every page [GitHub](https://github.com/adamspe) is where I'm
storing example software projects, etc. and this site is where I hope to do some minimal blogging about them.
